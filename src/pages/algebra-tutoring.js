          high schools, this can seem overwhelming. But it doesnâ€™t have to.

          To help out, MathPathSF.com is offering free algebra tutoring and test
          prep online. Our drop-in sessions will be held via Zoom on Thursdays
          at 5pm (with occasional exceptions). These classes are an easy way to
          ask questions and get homework help, and students may come to every
          session or drop-in as needed. The classes will run through May 2022,
          with an emphasis on Math Validation Test prep in April and May.
          Sessions will be run by Lowell High School student volunteers, most of
          whom took Algebra in 8th grade through BYU or Apex Learning.
