# Contributing to MathPathSF
I would prefer if people used Github issues for every suggestion, question, or comment. But if you don't know how to do that then you can email me at mathpathsf@gmail.com still including the information below.
## Feature Suggestion
Request features using Github issues.
* Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to describe the suggestion
* Provide a step by step description of the enhancement and what it would do
* Explain why this enhancement would be useful to users

### Article Change
If you want to suggest a change to an article still follow the steps above but also do these things.
* Say what page the text you want to change is on
* Copy and paste the original text you want to change
* Paste the added/changed text and explain what is different

## :bug: Bug Reports 
To report a bug create a Github issue.

* Use a clear and descriptive title to describe the issue
* Describe the exact steps to reproduce the problem
* Provide what happened after you followed the steps and what was wrong with that behavior
* Explain what behavior you were expecting to see and why
* Include what device you were using when the error occured
